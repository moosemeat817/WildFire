# 🔥 WildFire

Bring your fires to life! 

**WildFire** completely overhauls how the fires for campfires, stoves, fire barrels, rim grills, forges, and ammunition workbenches look and behave in *The Long Dark*, with **dynamic fuel-based colors**, **colorful spark displays and a variety of smoke states**, along **smooth lighting transitions** that react to whatever fuel you throw in.

## 🌈 Dynamic Fuel-Based Fire Colors

Every fuel burns differently — and now your fires do too.

- **Automatic Color Tracking:** Fire color updates in real-time based on the fuel you add.  
- **Intelligent Color Blending:** Mixes multiple fuels with weighted color blending for smooth transitions.  
- **Persistent Colors:** Fuel colors linger based on burn time.    
- **Smooth Transitions:** No sudden pops — just a clean, cinematic fade between colors.
- **Color Change Duration Setting:** A multiplier of items burn times that adjusts how long the color changes will last.

> Example: Toss in magnesium powder for a blinding white blaze, or rubidium for a moody violet flame.

## ⚡ Enhanced Spark Effects

Because every good fire deserves a little drama.

- **Fuel Addition Sparks:** Every time you add a custom fuel or vanilla fuel with effect attributes, you’ll see a custom spark burst.  
- **Per-Fuel Customization:** Included fuel types have unique spark behavior — emission rate, lifetime, color, speed, and size.  
- **Global Overrides:** Optionally apply your own universal spark settings to all fires.

## 💨 Advanced Smoke Modifications

Every fire tells a story — and now, so does its smoke.

- **Fuel-Specific Smoke:** Included fuels produce distinct smoke patterns, colors, and lifetimes.    
- **Global Override:** Force one consistent smoke style across all fuels.

## 💡 Dynamic Fire Lighting

Matching light to flame — all in real time.

- **Auto-Matched Colors:** Fire lights instantly adapt to the current fuel color.  
- **Smooth Transitions:** Lights gently lerp as colors shift.  
- **Intelligent Offsets:** Converts bright flame tones into realistic, natural light hues.
